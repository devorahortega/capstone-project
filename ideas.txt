CRUD:

Index:
  - show list of model chosen

Create:
  - creates an instance

Show:
  - show chosen instance

Update:
  - changes the instance

Delete
  - delete the instance

Models:
- prompts
- characters
- plot points
- flora + fauna
- places

If I was to simplify I would want to make an app that contains writing prompts only and allows users to create prompts. These prompts can be split up by 'tags'.
