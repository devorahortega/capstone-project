CRUD:

Index:
  - show list of model chosen

Create:
  - creates an instance

Show:
  - show chosen instance

Update:
  - changes the instance

Delete
  - delete the instance

Models:
- prompts
- characters
- plot points
- flora + fauna
- places
- category

If I was to simplify I would want to make an app that contains writing prompts only and allows users to create prompts. These prompts can be split up by 'tags' or categories.

For example, some writing prompts could be 'journal entries', 'fantasy', 'si-fi' etc.
